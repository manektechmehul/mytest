Done a huge round up and tidy up of items in this module, and decided to try and create a base listings module.
There are still a few hurdles to cross, with hard coded modules names used in places.

The module sill requires search with results to be enabled and standardised.

The menu and sub menu has been commented and tidied up.

Need to automate the installer somehow.

Currently writing mysql install scripts - need a way to control them via php.
