# start with running the a.sh file, like this
# Example:
# /home/httpd/vhosts/codebase.co.uk/httpdocs/utils/_scripts/makesite.sh lowflyersbusinesscoaching.com lowflyers dbname 
# you might need to add the database password at the end if you are running from php rather than from shell

## DO NOT USE AN EXISTING SITE NAME AS IT WILL OVER WRITE IT WITH BASE ##

open the shell terminal:

/home/httpd/vhosts/codebase.co.uk/httpdocs/utils/_scripts/getowner.sh pitsmoorsurgery.co.uk

/home/httpd/vhosts/codebase.co.uk/httpdocs/utils/_scripts/makesite.sh [folder[pitsmoorsurgery.co.uk]] [folder owner] [database name]
